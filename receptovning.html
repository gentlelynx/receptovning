        <h1>Parsnip soup</h1>
        <article>
            <p>This easy, creamy parsnip soup is made extra-filling with the addition of chunky croûtons. Start with the basic 4-ingredient recipe, and take it from there. Add the gruyère if you want a touch of luxury, or try adding some cooked ham hock or crisp fried bacon.</p>
            <p>For this recipe you will need a blender.</p>

        <h2>Ingridients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
            <li>2 garlic cloves</li>
            <li>600 gr parsnips</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp dried red chilli flakes</li>
            <li>1 l vegetable stock</li>
            <li>200 ml double cream</li>
            <li>salt & black pepper</li>
            <li>3 thick slices good bread</li>
            <li>55 g finely grated cheese (optional)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Method</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 200C/180C Fan/Gas 6.</li>
            <li>Heat the oil in a heavy-based saucepan over a medium heat. Add the garlic and parsnips and fry for 4–5 minutes, stirring occasionally, until coloured. Add the chilli and fry for 1 minute.</li>
            <li>Pour in the stock, stir and bring to a simmer. Cook with the lid on for 12–15 minutes, or until the parsnips are tender.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, for the croûtons, put the bread on a baking tray in a single layer and drizzle with the oil. Sprinkle over the cheese, if using, and season with salt and pepper. Bake for 5–10 minutes, or until crisp and golden.</li>
            <li>Remove the soup from the heat and blitz with a stick blender until smooth. Return to the heat, stir in the cream and heat through. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Serve the soup topped with the croûtons and a sprinkling of chilli flakes if you wish.</li>
        </ol>
